# Branch

Branch is a super super simple addon for Godot to show the current git branch you are working with.
It shows a button with the current branch name:

![Alt text](screenshots/branch.PNG?raw=true "Plugin")

Clicking on the button refreshes the branch name. 

### Why not more?
Because I just needed that. If others use the plugin, I can add more features.

## Installation

1. Copy the "addons" folder to your project. 
2. Enable the plugin in your project settings.
